* Stems from S which was created in 1975â€“1976
  
  - Prior to S statistics was done in Fortran
  
  - S was designed to run interactively with consistent interface to many statistical routines
  
  - Created as an IDE with a REPL and connected graphics device
  
  - S-PLUS was commercial, in 1992 R was created
  
  - "[R] is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme" (R-FAQ)
